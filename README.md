SOLID Principles Applied
-Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
  SRP means a class has one role. Students handle general information; subclasses manage their own attributes and tuition. This keeps roles clear.
-Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
  OCP means classes can be extended, not changed. The abstract Student class lets you add types via new subclasses.
